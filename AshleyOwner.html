							<p>I have 16 years of experience working as a veterinary assistant/technician and petsitting. I can provide the best possible care for your furry family members and will treat them as if they were my own. Whether your pet(s) needs daily walks or someone to come spend time with them while you're at work or are away, I got you covered! I have experience caring for senior pets, special needs pets and medical needs pets. I am experienced working with caring for puppies and kittens as well. As a veterinary professional, if your dog(s) or cat(s) have medical needs, I can provide medication administration: oral, topical and/or injectable as well as subcutaneous fluid administration. When your pet is with me, you can expect them to receive lots of love, exercise (or slow adventure walks for the older guys), attention and play, and you will receive daily updates including photos of your pets. I enjoy working with pets of all sizes, energy levels and ages. Your fur babies will be in good hands with me!</p>
